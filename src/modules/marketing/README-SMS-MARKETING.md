  status: 'Draft' | 'Scheduled' | 'In Progress' | 'Completed';
  createdAt: string;
  sentAt?: string;
  stats?: {
    totalRecipients: number;
    responseRate: number;
    optOutRate: number;
  };

  name: string;
  phone: string;
  status: 'Delivered' | 'Failed' | 'Pending' | 'Replied' | 'Opted Out';
  reply?: string;
  replyTimestamp?: string;

## User Experience Considerations

The SMS Marketing Agent is designed with the following UX principles in mind:

## Best Practices for SMS Marketing

The feature encourages SMS marketing best practices:

2. **Clear Opt-out Instructions**: Always include a way for recipients to opt out (e.g., "Reply STOP to opt out").
3. **Value Proposition**: Ensure each message provides clear value to the recipient.
4. **Timing Consideration**: Schedule messages during appropriate hours (typically business hours).
5. **Personalization**: Use segmentation to send relevant messages to the right audience.
